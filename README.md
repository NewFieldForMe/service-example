# service-example
The reason for making this repository is to do training build a basic service by self. Sorry for that my English is so cheap. This basic service will have view articles, post article, user login, and small SNS. But, this codebase is progress working gradually. Golang is used to back-end. Angular is used to front-end.

### Run Develop BackEnd in local
To run backend in local use gin to hotreload.
```  
cd web-back/src/app
gin -p 8000 -a 8001
```
